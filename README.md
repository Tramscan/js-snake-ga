# js-snake-ga
A snake genetic algorithm in python for the snake game found on patorjk.com/games/snake/ . Works now.
REQUIRED LIBRARIES (do pip install [Library] on windows):
selenium
os

you also need to download chromedriver and put it in the scripts folder of python34 if you're using spyder.
(Availible here: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/getting-started)
Where it says "chromedriver="c:/Python34/Scripts/chromedriver" one line 24 replace that with the location of chromedriver.
I reccomend to put it in C:/Python34/Scripts so you don't have to do any work.
I'm sorry, but mac users might have to figure some stuff out on their own, I don't own a mac so I don't know what else there is to fix though. It should be pretty easy to set up.
